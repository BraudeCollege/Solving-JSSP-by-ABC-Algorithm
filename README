An artificial bee colony (ABC) is an optimization algorithm based on the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarm. 
The job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is the problem of assigning the job in the system in a manner that will optimize
the overall performance, while assuring the correctness of the result. 
ABC algorithm is proposed in this paper for solving the JSSP with the criterion minimize 
the maximum completion time (makespan).
